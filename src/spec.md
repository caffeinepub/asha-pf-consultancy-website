# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the landing page by removing the Process section, adding a hero credibility line, and integrating new “ASHA PF CONSULTANCY” logo assets (including favicon).

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the entire “Our Simple Process” section so it is no longer rendered anywhere, including removing all process step cards (Case Review, Documentation, EPFO Follow-up, Amount Credited).
- Add the exact credibility line “Helped more than 1000 individuals” to the hero area, styled to match the existing design and remain legible on mobile and desktop.
- Add new generated static logo assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, display the logo in the hero near the main heading, and configure a favicon in `frontend/index.html` to use the new icon.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a simplified landing page without the Process section, a new “Helped more than 1000 individuals” credibility line in the hero, and ASHA PF CONSULTANCY branding with a logo in the hero and a favicon in the browser tab.
