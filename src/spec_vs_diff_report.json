  "summary": "REQ-14 and REQ-15 appear implemented: the Hero section no longer shows a logo <img>, and frontend/index.html no longer references the generated logo favicon asset. However, App.tsx includes additional admin-view toggling behavior that was not requested in this BuildRequest.",

    {
      "description": "Admin panel view toggle / inclusion of AdminSubmissionsView in the main App flow (showAdmin state and conditional rendering).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to removing the hero logo image and removing the logo-based favicon; it explicitly states this is a frontend-only change and does not request adding or altering admin UI/navigation.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (imports AdminSubmissionsView, defines showAdmin state, conditionally returns <AdminSubmissionsView ... />)"
